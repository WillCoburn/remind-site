    <h2>5. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>The Service may offer a subscription (currently $0.99 per month). Payment will be charged to your Apple App Store or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage and cancel your subscription through your app store account settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>

      <li>No use of the Service to message recipients without their consent.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. User Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of the affirmations and other content you submit. By submitting content, you grant ReMind a limited license to store it and deliver it back to you via SMS, email, or other features of the Service. You are solely responsible for your content.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service uses third-party providers, including Firebase (authentication and storage) and Twilio (SMS messaging). By using the Service, you also agree to comply with their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights in the Service and its content (other than your user-generated content) are owned by the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer the Service except as allowed by law.</p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers &amp; Limitation of Liability</h2>
